      <p>‘Difficulty’ in games is entirely relative to individual players; what’s ‘ultra hard’ and ‘unplayable’ for one is ‘too easy’ and ‘boring’ for another. Meaning, it’s a construct of the realities that game designers create, delicately tailored to the perceptions of their audience. And accessibility – my focus as a consultant on games, working with AAA developers like Guerrilla to Indies like Gambrinous – is an area of game design that’s often deeply misunderstood; it’s about barriers, not difficulty. So, by focusing on “difficulty modes” we might miss wider opportunities of being able to welcome more players because they may perceive any number of barriers to playing well or pain/stress free as ‘difficulty’. I’m here not just as an expert trying to shed some light, but also as a passionate fan of gruelling games like Souls-likes who wouldn’t want to see any of their defining qualities diminished.</p>

      <h2>Punishment, But It Feels So Good</h2>
      <p>Before I launch into the thick of it, it’s important I explore why I like punishing myself so much with said gruelling games. It’s fundamental to understanding why on Earth anyone else would want in on that.</p>
      <p>I have physical and cognitive disabilities with overly complicated medical names, but it boils down to muscle strength and pain. My joints dislocate and I injure easily (more pain). I’ve had strokes that affect things like memory along with brain fog, and I’m also autistic and have ADHD which all affect my ability to process any kind of information, organize tasks, and think quickly. Because playing any kind of game isn’t just a physical task, but a cognitive one too.</p>
      <p>So, I’m disabled and I completed Bloodborne solo, beating most bosses in around two to five attempts. It was an intensely emotional experience; harrowing at times, uplifting, damning, terrifying, beautiful, shocking, and painful. It’s a method of storytelling that’s unique, affecting, and quite indescribable. For me, this is the heart of Souls-like games, and it draws me in again and again. The Surge is the only game in 30+ years of playing games that I’ve completed three times! Quite the statement for a player with ADHD.</p>
      <p>The experience of a Souls-like leaves me raw and vulnerable in a way no other game does. The act of repeatedly failing, combined with seemingly unbeatable odds is beautifully contrasted with my natural abilities to persist, find strength amongst weakness, and learn. I’m a heavily determined person, often much to my own detriment, and these games reward that.</p>
      <p>Despite my cleverness and absolutely dogged resolve to succeed, I’m left exhausted and utterly vulnerable. I’m frequently beaten to within an inch of flailing despondently, but I find a way to come back victorious. Or, that’s how a good Souls-like ingeniously makes me feel through subtly crafted mechanics and near-invisible guidance. While I’m on the verge of tears, utterly broken, shakily mumbling ‘I can’t do this’, I have a breakthrough; I scrounge up the last of my courage, grit, and strength and… I win. Just like that.</p>
      <p>It’s a truly fascinating psychological and physical journey because there’s more to it – it’s the intimate relationship between mechanics and story. The stories at their core are always about transcending the darkest times, beating the odds, and striving to come back from nothing short of desolation. The way the punishing gameplay echoes the storytelling is so commanding, it can only be experienced by playing. It’s such a simultaneously ugly and beautiful representation of life and existentialism.</p>
      <p>For me, these games are special because it’s so much like my life. Being disabled is about navigating the world in permanent Hard Mode; constantly facing barriers, threats, and the painful realities of existence, yet I’m a survivor because I’m human. It says a lot about the concept of difficulty that I can even make that analogy.</p>
      <p>Sure, there are some things I can’t do, and that’s okay; it’s life, for everyone. But for disabled people, we often can’t join in just because no one thought of us. It’s unbearably isolating and sad to be faced with other people’s palpable joy and camaraderie when you have to watch from the sidelines, again. It’s also not always an all-or-nothing situation of can or can’t. Sometimes, doing the thing is painful or extra exhausting (i.e. harder than it should be). So, yes, I completed Bloodborne, but in doing so I was left with hand injuries that took months to heal – and I’m not being hyperbolic. Playing exhausted me, both mentally and physically. It made me hyper-aware of my limitations as a disabled player.</p>
      <p>When a game like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is released, the discussion often turns to “difficulty modes” in part because people want to join in, in a healthy way that works for their needs. They’re tired of being shut out completely or being made to feel inadequate because of their limitations. They desperately want to be a part of the hype. Missing out on the latest big deal really hurts, especially when it happens as often as it does for disabled people.</p>
      <p>With the screams of ‘Git Gud’ comes the fundamental misunderstanding of what accessibility actually is. Is it “difficulty modes”? That’s sometimes a small part of it, but it’s also so much more. Difficulty options are just one potential axis in which to solve unintentional barriers that disabled - and plenty of non-disabled - players face, but they’re not always the best way to solve them. In my job, I actively encourage teams to approach the subject with nuance and creativity because there’s the affronting misconception that disabled players can just, well, “play on easy”.</p>
