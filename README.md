# CUCTF
I, with my super-talented friends organized <b><i>WIZCON</b></i>, a hacker conference where I gave a talk on <b><i>"Web Application Security and Bug Bounty"</b></i> followed by <b><i>CUCTF</b></i>, a 6 hour CTF Challenge comprising different types of CTF Challenges, like <b><i>WEB, OSINT, CRYPTO, PWN, MISC, et cetera.</b></i>
<br><br>
<b>Here are the WEB Challenges that I created for CUCTF.</b>
