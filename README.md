# CUCTF
I, with my super-talented friends organized WIZCON, a hacker conference where I gave a talk on "Web Application Security and Bug Bounty" followed by CUCTF, a 6 hour CTF Challenge comprising different types of CTF Challenges, like WEB, OSINT, CRYPTO, PWN, MISC, et cetera.

Here are the WEB Challenges that I created for CUCTF.
